## About This Project

This is our college project for Web Technologies Lab. We have made a Task Management System where you can add tasks, edit them, delete them, and mark them as complete. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The project demonstrates CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) which we learned in class.

---

## What Does It Do?

Our application can:
- Add new tasks with details like title, description, priority, category and due date
- Show all your tasks in a nice list
- Edit any task if you want to change something
- Delete tasks you don't need anymore
- Mark tasks as completed when you finish them
- Filter tasks to see All, Pending, or Completed ones
- Show your data in XML format (for assignment requirement)
- Save all your tasks so they don't disappear when you close the browser

---

## Technologies We Used

**Frontend:**
- HTML5 - for making the structure of the webpage
- CSS3 - for styling and making it look good
- JavaScript - for making everything work

**For Data:**
- localStorage - saves data in browser (works like a database)
- JSON - format to store task data
- XML - another format to show data (requirement for assignment)

**Other Concepts:**
- DOM Manipulation - to change the webpage dynamically
- Form Validation - to check if user enters correct data
- Event Handling - to make buttons and forms work
